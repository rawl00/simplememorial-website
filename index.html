        <h1>Tributes</h1> <br>
        <h2>Tribute from his wife Janet Moraa</h2> <br>
        <p>Life has had varying chances for us. We've seen highs and lows together. We've grown from one stage to another together. We've known happiness and sorrow together.
            Above all, we've raised two wonderful sons together, sons who have learnt to appreciate the importance of founding and raising a family through observing our actions and inactions, the two vital sources of knowledge and wisdom.
            Your presence in our lives as a family was a blessing, a source of security and pride. 
            Your demise leaves a gaping hole that will never be filled! Go thee well till we meet again on that beautiful shore in that land that's brighter than day!
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Tribute from sons</h2> <br>
        <H3>Peter</H3>
        <p>Daddy,
            I am eternally grateful for the life you gave us.
             You've brought us up to this stage where, unfortunately, you've left before seeing us graduate to the next level where you'll gleefully guide us bring up your grandchildren.
            I've seen you and mummy work hard to raise us. I've seen you push us to achieve our goals in life, admonishing us that nobody else can do it for us but we ourselves alone! 
            It's that urging that will echo in our minds forever as we celebrate the life we lived when you were here! I promise to support mum, always, in our attempt to protect and take care of her.
            We are proud of you daddy, rest in eternal peace daddy, amen! <br></BR></p>
          
          <h3>Rawlings</h3> 
          <p>It's sad to know that my dad left us exactly on Monday 20th September, 2021, but again it is a loving memory for me when I think about the life of my dad & all he did for me in the short time 
            we spent together. The good memories remain with me forever, knowing the ability impacted by my dad into my life. All the good things that he taught me. An intelligent and intellectual man full
            of jokes, always stresses the importance of education and hard work in life to become a great person... Daddy, my heart bleeds each time I remember that you are gone, but your loving & caring fatherly
            role will continue lingering in my humble heart. This death won't separate us as I would soon grow old and exit just like you did and we meet again soon to continue as father and son. 
            If we have forgotten to show our gratitude enough for all the things you did, we're thanking you now. And we are hoping you knew all along, how much you meant to us.
            Farewell Dad. <strong> We love you!</strong></p>
